# Introduction

DBSQLCLI is a command line interface (CLI) for [Databricks SQL](https://databricks.com/product/databricks-sql) that can do auto-completion and syntax highlighting, and is a proud member of the dbcli community.

# Quick Start

## Install

You can download the latest architecture-specific binary from the releases page. The `x86` build will work on MacOS/Windows/Linux with Intel chips. Apple silicon macs should use the `arm` binary.

To launch dbsqlcli from anywhere, add the directory where you saved the binary to your PATH. You can do this by appending the following to your `~/.zshrc` 

```zsh
export PATH="$PATH:/path/to/directory/with/dbsqlcli"
```

### Install via `pip`


During its internal release, `dbsqlcli` is not available via `pip`.

## Authentication

To connect with SQL Endpoints `dbsqlcli` needs the host name and http path from the [connection details](https://docs.databricks.com/integrations/bi/jdbc-odbc-bi.html#get-connection-details-for-a-sql-endpoint) screen in Databricks SQL and a [personal access token](https://docs.databricks.com/dev-tools/api/latest/authentication.html#token-management). These can be passed in as arguments to `dbsqlcli` or by environment variables.

## Config

A config file is automatically created at `~/.dbsqlcli/dbsqlclirc` at first launch (run `dbsqlcli`). See the file itself for a description of all available options. Most users will not need to modify this file.


## Run a query

``` bash
$ dbsqlcli -e 'select id, name from minifigs LIMIT 10'
```

## REPL

``` bash
$ cd <directory containing dbsqlcli binary>
$ ./dbslqcli [<database_name>]
```

# Features

- Auto-completes as you type for SQL keywords as well as tables and columns in the database.

- Smart-completion will suggest context-sensitive completion.
    - `SELECT * FROM <tab>` will only show table names.
    - `SELECT * FROM users WHERE <tab>` will only show column names.
